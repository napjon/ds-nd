# Summary

The visualization measures the performance of 2015 US
Flight.
Performance based on how much on time number of flights, and how it
decrease vary based on number of flights delay,cancelled,diverted.
Second plot measures delay vary based on weather,airlines, etc.

# Design

After collecting the feedback, in the first plot  I notice that number of flights delay
doesn't really cared that much, and they just prefer to have total delay
altogether. So based on this, I will just use total number of flights
delay. However on-time flights doesn't just decrease because of the
delay, it's also caused by number of flights cancelled and diverted.

For second plot, users confused with y-ticks. Since the title of the
second plot said concerning about the delayed minutes, they expect
labeled y-ticks "m" to mean minutes, while it's representing number in
millions. Since millions minutes will waste ink more in visualization, I
change the format to hour period.

# Feedback

## Person 1

* What do you notice in the visualization?
I notice, there is no significant turn on both graph. Consistency on both fligh operation & delayed flight are steady.
* What questions do you have about the data?
No question
* What relationships do you notice?
The more flight operation, should be, the more chance delayed flight
* What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?
US flight operation runs steady
* Is there something you don’t understand in the graphic?
I think graphic quite clear. I understand.

## Person 2

What do you notice in the visualization?
I notice that the number of on-time flight is way more compare to the
delay flight

What questions do you have about the data?
With Such a high number of delayed flighht, how come the total Minutes
is very small?

What relationships do you notice?
The Relation between carrier Delay and Late Arrival is highly correlated
base on totalhe second graph

What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?

The Graph is pretty straight forward and easy to digest

Is there something you don’t understand in the graphic?
I can’t really understand is there a relationship between number of
flight with the amount of delays.

## Person 3

* y-axis is misleading, is it in minutes? Why so small?
* Better to use bar chart type
* We can just see delay line plot in detail at the plot below. No need
  in the first plot.
